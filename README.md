## Optional
You can make **watch++** the default app that will be started after booting the card10.
To do so rename the [__init__.py](__init__.py) to `main.py` and drop it in the root folder of your card10 badge to use the digital clock as default app that is getting startet after your badge has been booted.

OR

set latest version of watch++ as default app by executing:

```
wget -O /Volumes/CARD10/main.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/christian-draeger/watch-plus-plus/master/__init__.py
```
